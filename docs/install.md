# Install

- **peerDependencies**:

  **tw-themes** has a peerDependency on **tailwindcss** _which also needs to
  be configured_.  Most likely you should already have this installed
  ... but just in case:

  ```shell
  npm install --save tailwindcss
  ```

- **the main event**:

  ```shell
  npm install --save tw-themes
  ```
