# NPM Scripts

This section provides a summary of the available **NPM Scripts**
_(organized by task)_:


```
DEVELOPMENT
===========
JS:
test:watch ..... run test suite, continuously watching for module changes

DOCS:
docs:build   ... manually build the docs (into the _book/ dir)
                 1. start an internal web server pointing to _book/ dir
                 2. manually re-execute docs:build whenever docs/ change


TESTING
=======
test ........... run test suite, one time
test:watch ..... run test suite, continuously watching for module changes


DOCS             NOTE: we PUBLISH our docs
====
docs:build   ... manually build the docs (into the _book/ dir)
                 - NOTE: this build is executed as the first step in docs:publish
                 - FOR DOCS DEVELOPMENT:
                   1. start an internal web server pointing to _book/ dir
                   2. manually re-execute docs:build whenever docs/ change
                 - this is MUCH PREFERRED over docs:serve
                   * it is MUCH FASTER!
                   * docs:serve is very antiquated (a dead project)
                     * it is extremely slow
                     * it constantly stops when any file changes
                                    
docs:publish ... publish the latest docs to https://tw-themes.js.org/
                 NOTE: this script FIRST builds the docs from scratch
                       ... via predocs:publish

docs:clean   ... clean machine-generated docs/ directory

                 >>> ANTIQUATED (see notes on docs:build)
docs:serve ..... launch docs server, continuously watching for docs changes
                 NOTE: adding `--log=debug --debug` to this npm script CAN BE USEFUL


BUNDLE/DEPLOY    NOTE: we DEPLOY our bundled library to NPM
=============
lib:build ...... build library bundle in lib/ directory
                 NOTE: This script FIRST insures all unit tests pass
                       ... via prelib:build

lib:clean ...... clean machine-generated lib/ directory

                 NOTE: to deploy library:
                 $ npm publish
                   ... will auto build lib/ directory
                       via: "prepare": "npm run lib:build" 
                   ... and deploy to NPM


MISC
====
clean .......... AI: cleans ALL machine-generated directories
```

# Dependencies

This section provides some insight regarding the various dependencies
found in **tw-themes**.

The dependency list can become quite large for a mature project.  In
looking at `package.json`, the inevitable questions are:

- What is this dependency

- Why is it needed

- Is it a dependency for project tooling or application code?

The following table itemizes the **tw-themes** dependencies,
referencing when/where they were introduced/configured.

Dependency                        | Type        | Usage                          | Refer To

# Project Setup

This section chronicles the original setup of the **tw-themes**
project.

If you are forking this project, this detail is _unnecessary_, because
you simply `npm install` and then commence your development.

With that said, this section provides valuable insight on how the
project was originally setup and configured, and can be used in other
projects _(where you are starting from scratch)_!

**NOTE**: These sections roughly represent the chronology of when they
were carried out, however in some cases the order can be changed.

**Sub Sections**:
  - [Setup GitHub Project]
  - [Initialize NPM Project]
  - [Setup Unit Testing]
  - [Setup Docs Tooling]
  - [Setup js.org sub-domain]
  - [Setup Lib Packaging]

# Setup GitHub Project

There are many ways of initiating a new GitHub project. I'll leave the
details to you :-)

At the end of this process you should have:

- A new GitHub project
- A local git repository (for your development)
- Impacted Files:
  ```
    tw-themes/
      .git/ ................ our local git repo
      .gitignore ........... git repo exclusions (typically machine generated)
      LICENSE.md............ MIT License
      README.md ............ basic project docs
  ```

# Initialize NPM Project

This task will initialize the project as an NPM project.

At the end of this process you should have:

- **tw-themes** initialized as an NPM project, with it's `tailwindcss`
  peerDependency.

- Impacted Dependencies:
  ```
  tailwindcss ... our peerDependency (what tw-themes is built on)
  ```

- Impacted Files:
  ```
  tw-themes/
    .gitignore ........... modified as needed
    node_modules/ ........ install location of dependent packages (maintained by npm)
    package.json ......... project meta data with dependencies
    package-lock.json .... exhaustive dependency list with installed "locked" versions (maintained by npm)
  ```

**Summary**:

1. Create `package.json` file at project root, with following the
   characteristics _(this contains our `tailwindcss` peerDependency)_:

   ```js
   {
     "name": "tw-themes",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "description": "powerful tailwind color themes (dynamically selectable at run-time)",
     "homepage": "https://tw-themes.js.org/",
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "https://github.com/KevinAst/tw-themes.git"
     },
     "keywords": [
       "tailwind",
       "themes",
       "theme",
       "dark",
       "dark-mode",
       "colors",
       "web",
       "utility",
       "geeku",
       "astx"
     ],
     "author": "Kevin J. Bridges <kevin@wiiBridges.com> (https://github.com/KevinAst)",
     "license": "MIT",
     "scripts": {
       "L8TR": "L8TR"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "tailwindcss": ">=2.0.0"
     },
     "peerDependencies": {
       "tailwindcss": ">=2.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Initialize Node/NPM:

   ```
   $ cd c:/dev/tw-themes
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Update `.gitignore` with following:

   ```
   # node dependencies (defined via "npm install")
   /node_modules/

   # not really interested in package-lock.json in repo
   /package-lock.json

   ... snip snip
   ```

_My personal Detailed Notes are "hidden" (in comment form) in this doc ..._

<!--- Comment out KJB Notes
**Details**:
```
In addition to above:

- configure VSCode
  * setup VSCode workspace file (and edit):
    c:/dev/tw-themes.code-workspace 
  * launch this workspace
  * N/A: ONE TIME: NOW load the VSCode "svelte" extension
```

# Setup Unit Testing

**tw-themes** uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) as it's unit
testing framework.

**Links**:
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)
- [Jest Installation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html)

At the end of this process you should have:

- The ability to use Jest in running the test suite.

- Impacted Dependencies:
  ```
  @babel/core
  @babel/preset-env
  babel-jest
  jest
  ```

- Impacted Files:
  ```
  tw-themes/
    babel.config.js
    jest.config.js
  ```

**Installation Details**:

- Install required dependencies (Jest and Babel).

  **NOTE**: Some of these dependencies overlap with other setup (Install
  only what is missing):

  ```
  $ npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env jest babel-jest
    + babel-jest@26.6.3
    + jest@26.6.3
    + @babel/preset-env@7.13.10
    + @babel/core@7.13.10
      added 576 packages from 365 contributors and audited 658 packages in 37.522s
  ```

- Configure Jest/Babel by adding two files _(in project root)_:
  * **jest.config.js**:
    ```js
    // configuration of jest unit tests
    module.exports = {
      transform: {
        "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
      },
      moduleFileExtensions: ["js"],
    
      // KJB: other UNNEEDED (I think)
      // testPathIgnorePatterns: ["node_modules"],
      // bail: false,
      // verbose: true,
      // transformIgnorePatterns: ["node_modules"],
    };
    ```
  * **babel.config.js**:
    ```js
    // babel needed for jest unit tests :-(
    module.exports = {
      presets: [
        [
          "@babel/preset-env",
          {
            targets: {
              node: "current"
            }
          }
        ]
      ]
    };
    ```

- Setup the **Testing NPM Scripts**:
  **package.json**:
  ```js
  ... snip snip

  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test":       "jest src",
    "test:watch": "npm run test -- --watch"
  },

  ... snip snip
  ```

# Setup Docs Tooling

**tw-themes** promotes it's documentation through [GitHub Pages],
using [GitBook], which is a [Markdown] based solution.  This
configuration setup is patterned after the following article _(minus
the JSDoc)_: [Integrating GitBook with JSDoc to Document Your Open
Source Project].

At the end of this process you should have:

- Documentation setup through [Markdown] files, deployable to [GitHub Pages].

- Impacted Dependencies:
  ```
  gh-pages
  gitbook-cli
  rimraf
  ```

- Impacted Files:
  ```
  package.json ...... enhance docs dependencies -and- docs scripts
  book.json ......... GitBook configuration
  docs/ ............. master source of GitBook project docs
    toc.md .......... the summary TOC (seen in the left nav)
    intro.md ........ the Guide Introduction
    *.md ............ various Markdown files making up our docs
    sectionN/ ....... optional docs dirs (as required)
      *.md
    styles/
      website.css ... gitbook style overrides
  _book/ ............ machine generated docs (output of GitBook)
    *.html
    *.js
    *.css
  ```

**Installation Details**:

1. Install the [GitBook command-line interface]

   ```
   $ npm install --save-dev gitbook-cli
     + gitbook-cli@2.3.2
       added 577 packages from 672 contributors and audited 1234 packages in 32.693s
   ```

   KJB: Yikes: this is the same version installed 3 years ago (in feature-u).

   It has 10K downloads / week, but was last published 4 years ago ... hmmm

2. Define following doc-related project files

   **NOTE**: To find the installed gitbook version (referenced in `book.json` below):
   ```
   $ npx gitbook ls
     GitBook Versions Installed:
     * 3.2.2
       2.5.2
   ```

   ```
   book.json (GitBook configuration)
   =========
     {
       "gitbook":     "3.2.2",
       "root":        "./docs",
       "title":       "tw-themes",
       "description": "powerful tailwind color themes (dynamically selectable at run-time)",
       "author":      "Kevin J. Bridges <kevin@wiiBridges.com> (https://github.com/KevinAst)",
       "structure": { 
         "readme":  "intro.md",
         "summary": "toc.md" 
       }
     }

   docs/

     toc.md (defines the left-nav)
     ======
       # Table of content 
       
       ### tw-themes (0.1.0)
       * [Getting Started](start.md)
       
       ----

     intro.md (docs introduction)
     ========
       # tw-themes

       **tw-themes** is a tailwindcss utility that facilitates _**dynamic
       color themes that are selectable at run-time**_.

     start.md (our getting started)
     ========
       # Getting Started
       This is the **Getting Started** section.
       Here are some references to the [Introduction](intro.md)
       and [API](api.md).
   ```

3. Install gh-pages (used in npm scripts below)

   ```
   $ npm install --save-dev gh-pages
     + gh-pages@3.1.0
       added 28 packages from 10 contributors and audited 1262 packages in 10.237s
   ```

4. Install rimraf (used in npm scripts below)

   ```
   $ npm install --save-dev rimraf
     + rimraf@3.0.2
       updated 1 package and audited 1263 packages in 7.012s
   ```

5. Define the following **docs-related NPM scripts**:

   **package.json**:
   ```js
   ... snip snip
   "scripts": {
     ...
     "docs:build":            "gitbook build",
     "docs:serve":            "gitbook serve",
     "predocs:publish":       "npm run docs:build",
     "docs:publish":          "gh-pages --dist _book",
     "docs:gitbook:help":     "gitbook help",
     "docs:clean":            "rimraf _book"
     ...
   },
   ... snip snip
   ```

6. Prep/Initialize gitbook plugins.  This step is needed whenever you
   add gitbook plugins via `book.json`. As an example the `toolbar`
   plugin (mentioned below).

   ```
   $ npx gitbook install
         info: nothing to install!
               KJB: This command only needs to be run when gitbook plugins
                    are added to book.json
   ```

7. Serve up docs to test our setup

   ```
   $ npm run docs:serve
   ```

   And browse: http://localhost:4000/

   **Resolve Issues**
   ```
   - It appears that gitbook-cli is so old that it has issues running
     in a modern node/npm.

     Starting to question is gitbook is the best option for documentation
     ... at least in future projects

   - When running either "docs:build"/"docs:serve" receive follow error:
     $ npx gitbook build
       C:\dev\tw-themes\node_modules\npm\node_modules\graceful-fs\polyfills.js:287
             if (cb) cb.apply(this, arguments)
                        ^
       TypeError: cb.apply is not a function
           at C:\dev\tw-themes\node_modules\npm\node_modules\graceful-fs\polyfills.js:287:18
           at FSReqCallback.oncomplete (fs.js:184:5)

     * found several mentions of this:

       1. Gitbook-cli install error TypeError: cb.apply is not a function inside graceful-fs
          ... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64211386/gitbook-cli-install-error-typeerror-cb-apply-is-not-a-function-inside-graceful
          * they talk about gitbook-cli working in node v12 and NOT in node v14
          * they install a newer version of graceful-fs@latest IN gitbook-cli
            $ cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/
            $ npm install graceful-fs@latest --save

       2. How I fixed a "cb.apply is not a function" error while using Gitbook
          ... https://flaviocopes.com/cb-apply-not-a-function/
          > a real hack:
          * this guy commented out code in node_modules:
            node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js

              >>> PUNT and DO THIS (this is how I got it working):
            - in MY case the problem code is found here:
              c:/dev/tw-themes/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js
              * comment out the lines 62-64:
                // KJB: HACK to fix STALE gitbook-cli (see: TOOLING.md)
                // fs.stat = statFix(fs.stat)
                // fs.fstat = statFix(fs.fstat)
                // fs.lstat = statFix(fs.lstat)
              * IT WORKS!

   - The docs server will crash when any docs files change.
     ... this was even happening when I developed my other project's docs.
     >>> JUST PUNT and live with this.
   ```

8. Follow customization suggestions found in [Integrating GitBook with
   JSDoc to Document Your Open Source Project].  

   Specifically:

   - Setup `docs/styles/website.css`
   - Disable livereload via "-livereload" option in "plugins" section of `book.json`
   - Disable social media sharing in toolbar via "-sharing" option in "plugins" section of `book.json`
   - Adding toolbar links to GitHub/NPM via "toolbar" plugin (configured in `book.json`).
     Don't forget to do your `$ npx gitbook install` to install the
     toolbar plugin referenced in `book.json`.

9. Install [`folding-menu`] GitBook plugin that "tames" large left-nav
   menus by visualizing one section at a time.

   - add following to `book.json`:

     **book.json**
     ```js
     {
       ...
       "plugins": [
         ... other plugins you may be using
         "folding-menu"
       ]

           "sticky":            false
         }
       }
     }
     ```

     There appears to be a bug in the folding-menu plugin "sticky" setting,
     where it is NOT informed of a top-level page change when done via a
     link.  As a result I have disabled this option ("sticky": false).

# Setup js.org sub-domain

To accommodate a more professional URL, [js.org] supports a
sub-domain registration process.

At the end of this process you should have:

- A github pages `js.org` sub-domain: 
  * FROM: https://kevinast.github.io/tw-themes/
  * TO:   https://tw-themes.js.org/

To accomplish this, simply follow the instructions on [js.org].  Here
is my summary _(more notes hidden here in comment form)_:

```
 - First setup a preliminary set of docs that are deployable to
   [GitHub Pages].  `js.org` requires "reasonable content" before
   they will approve your request.  Alternatively you can create
   some temporary content that shows your intent.


 - Create a CNAME file at gh-pages root.  In our case this will live
   in `docs/`:
   
   * docs/CNAME
     ==========
     tw-themes.js.org

   * Deploy your latest docs to [GitHub Pages]:

     ```
     $ npm run docs:publish
     ```

     NOTE: Once this is done, you will not be able to browse your gh-pages
           till js.org processes your PR (below).

 - Fork the `js.org` project and issue a PR to introduce our sub-domain
   * new entry in: cnames_active.js
     ... "tw-themes": "kevinast.github.io/tw-themes",

 - Monitor PR acceptance (will take 24 hrs).

 - Once complete the sub-domain should be active

   NOTE: the original gh-pages link to the new sub-domain
```

<!--- Comment out KJB Notes

****************
* setup js.org * ... can be done FIRST OR LAST
****************

  - either setup a preliminary set of docs -or- put a dummy page in place
    ... needed to be accepted by js.org

    * following temporary html file:
      - NOTE: has to be "reasonable content"
              - per their README, their focus is on granting subdomain requests to
                projects with a clear relation to the JavaScript ecosystem and
                community (NOT personal pages, blogs, etc.).
              - Projects such as NPM packages, libraries, tools that have a clear
                direct relation to JavaScript, will be accepted when requesting a
                JS.ORG subdomain.
              - KJB: My experience is that by a) placing limited content in, and b) referencing other project docs and your README
                     IT WILL BE ACCEPTED

      _docs/index.html
      ================
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>

          <h1>tw-themes</h1>
      
          <p><i>... minimalist form validation with powerful results</i></p>
          <p>
            Validating forms has notoriously been a painful development
            experience. Implementing client side validation in a user friendly way
            is a tedious and arduous process â€¢ you want to validate fields only at
            the appropriate time (when the user has had the chance to enter the
            data) â€¢ you want to present validation errors in a pleasing way â€¢ you
            may need to apply custom validation (specific to your application
            domain) â€¢ etc.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Even with the introduction of HTML5's Form Validation, it is still
            overly complex, and doesn't address many common scenarios (mentioned
            above). Without the proper approach, form validation can be one of the
            most difficult tasks in web development.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            This sub-domain is currently work-in-progress and will
            eventually hold BOTH the formal documentation and the deployed app
            <i>(similar to other projects under my control: e.g. <a href="http://feature-u.js.org/">http://feature-u.js.org/</a>)</i>
          </p>

# Setup Lib Packaging

This task will setup the tooling needed to package and deploy the
**tw-themes** library to NPM.

Currently we use a very simple packaging process that employs babel
only.  In other words, no bundler is used _(such as webpack or
rollup)_.

**Links**: [How to publish a npm package?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/publish-npm-package-node)

At the end of this process you should have:

- The ability to deploy the **tw-themes** library to NPM.

- Impacted Dependencies:
  ```
  @babel/cli
  @babel/core
  @babel/preset-env
  ```

- Impacted Files:
  ```
  tw-themes/
    .gitignore
    package.json
    babel.config.js
  ```

**Installation Details**:

- Install required dependencies (Babel).

  **NOTE**: Some of these dependencies overlap with other setup (Install
  only what is missing):

  ```
  $ npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/cli
  ```

- modify `package.json` with deployment-specific fields:

  **package.json** _(leave comments out)_:
  ```js
  {
    "name": "tw-themes",    // the name of the npm package
    "version": "0.1.0",     // the npm package version

                            // referenced in npm registry
    "description": "powerful tailwind color themes (dynamically selectable at run-time)",
    "homepage": "https://tw-themes.js.org/",
    "repository": {
      "type": "git",
      "url": "https://github.com/KevinAst/tw-themes.git"
    },
    "bugs": {
      "url": "https://github.com/KevinAst/tw-themes/issues"
    },
    "keywords": [
      "tailwind",
      "themes",
      "theme",
      "dark",
      "dark-mode",
      "colors",
      "web",
      "utility",
      "geeku",
      "astx"
    ],
    "author": "Kevin J. Bridges <kevin@wiiBridges.com> (https://github.com/KevinAst)",
    "license": "MIT",

    "main": "lib/index.js", // references the generated library bundle

    "files": [              // resources to include in the NPM package
      "package.json",
      "LICENSE.md",
      "README.md",
      "lib",
      "src"
    ],

    ... snip snip
  }
  ```

- Configure Babel:

  **babel.config.js**:
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    presets: [
      "@babel/preset-env"
    ]
  }
  ```

- define a `src/.npmignore` to omit modules that should NOT
  be included in the bundle (ex: unit tests):

  **src/.npmignore**
  ```
  # do NOT publish any spec/ directory (unit tests spread throughout our src/ code base)
  spec
  ```

- Setup the **lib: NPM Scripts**:

  **package.json** _(leave comments out)_:
  ```js
  {
    ...

    "scripts": {
      ...

      "lib:build":    "babel src --out-dir lib --no-comments",

      "prelib:build": "npm run test", // don't build unless unit tests are OK

      "lib:clean":    "rimraf lib"

      "prepare":      "npm run lib:build", // run build before `$ npm publish`
    },

    ... snip snip
  }
  ```

- Adjust `.gitignore`:

  **.gitignore**
  ```
  # bundled NPM distribution (generated via "npm run lib:build")
  # ... currently only using /lib/
  /dist/
  /lib/
  /es/
  ```

- Verify a manual build:

  ```
  $ run npm lib:build # see results in `lib/` directory
  ```



<!--- *** SECTION *************************************************************** --->
# Deploy Project

This section chronicles the steps in deploying **tw-themes** to NPM.

**Feature Branch**:

Typically all development is done in a **feature branch**.  If you are
about to deploy, presumably your branch is complete and documented.

1. insure all tests are operational

   ```
   $ npm run test
   ```

2. finalize version -and- history notes:

   - for the new version, use [semantic standards](http://semver.org/)

   - update version in:
     * `package.json`
     * `docs/toc.md` (version is referenced at top)
     * `docs/history.md` (within the "running" notes)

   - review/finalize all documentation impacted by change

   - optionally: save a neutral version of change history comments (to use in git tagging)
     * pull from history.md _(normalizing any reference links)_
     * ALTERNATE: simply reference the documentation history section (in the git tag)

       EX: https://tw-themes.js.org/history.html#v0_1_0

**main Branch**:

1. issue PR (pull request) and merge to main branch

2. sync main to local machine (where the deployment will occur)

3. verify version is correct in:
   * `package.json`
   * `docs/toc.md`
   * `docs/history.md`

4. now, everything should be checked in to main and ready to publish

5. tag the release (in github)

6. publish **tw-themes** to npm **_(THIS IS IT!)_**:

   ```
    $ npm publish
      + tw-themes@v.v.v
   ```

   verify publish was successful
   - receive email from npm
   - npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tw-themes
   - unpkg.com:   https://unpkg.com/tw-themes/

7. publish **tw-themes** documentation:

   ```
   $ npm run docs:publish
   ```
  
   verify publish docs was successful
   - https://tw-themes.js.org/
     * see new version
     * see correct history

8. optionally test the new package in an external project (by installing it)


<!--- *** SECTION *************************************************************** --->
# Setup New Feature Branch

This section documents the steps to setup a new **feature branch**
(where all development is typically done):

1. create a new branch (typically spawned from the "main" branch).

   **EX**: `next7`

2. devise "best guess" as to the next version number _(may be
   premature, but this can subsequently change)_.

   Reflect this in: 
   * `package.json`
   * `docs/toc.md` (version is referenced at top)
   * `docs/history.md` (within the "running" notes)

3. setup new running Revision History (in `docs/history.md`)

   This provides a place where we can incrementally maintain "running"
   revision notes.
